### **NCOS "Phoenix-Session" Architecture: The In-Session Model**

The core idea is to transform the server-based NCOS into a stateful, interactive toolkit managed directly by the LLM. The "Master Orchestrator" becomes a SessionController class, and the user's prompts drive the main event loop.

#### **1\. Core Architectural Changes**

* **Orchestration:** The MasterOrchestrator is refactored into a SessionController. Instead of a persistent server process, this is a Python object that holds the state for the duration of the chat session.  
* **Configuration:** We'll move away from multiple YAML files and consolidate configuration into a single, Pydantic-based Python module. This is easier to manage and modify within a code interpreter environment. The structure will be based on your established Configuration Structure.  
* **Data I/O:** Data ingestion will primarily rely on files uploaded directly into the session (e.g., Parquet, CSV) rather than live API connections or database queries.  
* **Visualization:** The NativeChartEngine will generate charts as image files or interactive HTML, which can be directly rendered and displayed in the chat interface.

#### **2\. The Bootstrap Prompt (AUTORUN.md)**

This is the initial instruction set you provide to the LLM to kickstart the NCOS session.

\# NCOS v21 PHOENIX-SESSION \- AUTORUN

\*\*Objective:\*\* Initialize the NCOS environment within this session.

\*\*Instructions:\*\*

1\.  \*\*Acknowledge Architecture:\*\* Confirm you have analyzed the provided architecture documents (\`NCOS\_v21\_ARCHITECTURE.md\`, \`CONSOLIDATION\_SUMMARY.json\`, etc.).  
2\.  \*\*Verify Dependencies:\*\* Ensure the necessary libraries from \`requirements.txt\` are available in the environment.  
3\.  \*\*Instantiate Controller:\*\* Import and instantiate the \`SessionController\` from \`ncos\_session.py\` using the default configuration.  
4\.  \*\*Confirm Readiness:\*\* Report that the "NCOS Session Controller is initialized and ready for commands."

#### **3\. The In-Session Controller (ncos\_session.py)**

This script will be the heart of the in-session application. It defines the configuration and the main controller class.

### **How This Fits The Vision**

* **Single LLM Session:** This entire framework is designed to be initialized and operated within one continuous conversation, fulfilling your core request.  
* **Interactive and Dynamic:** The SessionController provides clear entry points (run\_wyckoff\_analysis, generate\_analysis\_chart) for you to direct the analysis turn-by-turn.  
* **Leverages Existing Architecture:** This model directly uses the components and structures defined in your "Phoenix Mesh" documents, such as the 56 Pydantic models, 38 Wyckoff components, and the native charting engine1.  
* **Simplified Deployment:** It bypasses the need for Docker or Kubernetes, making the system instantly usable in any supported LLM environment. The QUICKSTART.md guide becomes even simpler: just upload the files and paste the AUTORUN.md prompt.  
* **Clear Migration Path:** The MIGRATION\_MATRIX.json remains relevant, as the consolidation of schemas and strategies into Python modules is the foundational step for this in-session model.

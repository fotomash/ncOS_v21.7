Gold (XAUUSD) M1 FVG Trading Logic
1. Core Concept: Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) / Imbalances
Definition: A Fair Value Gap (FVG), or imbalance, is a specific three-candle pattern on a price chart. It typically signifies a rapid price movement that has resulted in an inefficiency or an imbalance between buying and selling pressure at certain price levels.
Formation:
Bullish FVG: Identified by a gap between the high of the first candle's wick and the low of the third candle's wick. The middle (second) candle in this pattern usually shows a strong upward movement.
Bearish FVG: Identified by a gap between the low of the first candle's wick and the high of the third candle's wick. The middle (second) candle typically shows a strong downward movement.
Significance: The market has a tendency to revisit these FVG areas to "fill" the imbalance, as these gaps represent areas of minimal or inefficient trading activity.
2. Multi-Timeframe Analysis (MTFA) Framework
Objective: To establish a clear directional bias and identify significant Higher Timeframe (HTF) zones of interest.
Higher Timeframes (HTF - e.g., H4, H1):
Trend Determination: Analyze the sequence of highs and lows to determine the overall market trend (e.g., consistent higher highs and higher lows indicate an uptrend).
Identify HTF Points of Interest (POIs): Locate unmitigated FVGs or Order Blocks (OBs) on these higher timeframes that align with the established HTF trend.
In a bullish HTF trend, focus on POIs located in "discount" areas (lower portion) of significant bullish price legs.
In a bearish HTF trend, focus on POIs located in "premium" areas (upper portion) of significant bearish price legs.
Lower Timeframes (LTF - e.g., M15, M5):
Monitor Price Reaction: Observe how price behaves as it approaches the identified HTF POI.
Initial Structural Clues: Look for early indications of a structural shift on these LTFs (e.g., a Change of Character on M15) or a noticeable slowdown in momentum as price interacts with the HTF POI.
3. Liquidity Concepts
Liquidity Sweep (Stop Hunt): This occurs when price moves to an area where liquidity (e.g., stop-loss orders) is clustered, such as below previous lows in an uptrend or above previous highs in a downtrend. Price "sweeps" this liquidity before initiating a more significant move. FVGs that form after such a liquidity sweep often have a higher probability of being respected.
Inducement: Refers to price action that is deliberately engineered to entice retail traders into taking positions prematurely or on the wrong side of the market. This created liquidity is then often used by institutional players.
Key Liquidity Zones: Highs and lows of previous trading sessions (e.g., Asian session highs/lows) are often significant liquidity points that are targeted.
4. Market Structure Confirmation (M1 Timeframe)
Context: These confirmations are sought on the M1 timeframe after price has interacted with a validated HTF POI and typically after an M1 liquidity sweep has occurred.
Change of Character (CHoCH) on M1: This signals a potential shift in the immediate M1 trend.
Bullish Setup Scenario: After price taps a bullish HTF POI and performs an M1 liquidity sweep below a local M1 low, an M1 CHoCH is confirmed when price impulsively breaks above the most recent M1 lower high.
Bearish Setup Scenario: After price taps a bearish HTF POI and performs an M1 liquidity sweep above a local M1 high, an M1 CHoCH is confirmed when price impulsively breaks below the most recent M1 higher low.
Break of Structure (BoS) on M1: This confirms the continuation of the M1 trend, assuming it's already aligned with the HTF bias.
Used for continuation plays. If the M1 trend is already aligned with the HTF bias after a pullback to the HTF POI, an M1 BoS (e.g., price breaking a recent M1 high in an established M1 uptrend) confirms trend continuation.
Impulsive Nature: The M1 CHoCH or BoS must be a clear, impulsive, and decisive move, indicating a significant shift in order flow.
5. M1 FVG Identification and Entry Criteria
FVG Formation: The M1 FVG of interest should be created by the impulsive M1 price move that directly causes the M1 CHoCH or M1 BoS.
Entry Trigger:
The primary entry is on the retracement of price back into this newly formed M1 FVG.
Entry can be considered as price touches the edge of the FVG, or traders might wait for a partial fill (e.g., 50%) of the FVG.
High-Probability M1 FVG Entry Sequence (Example for a Long Trade):
HTF Bias: Established (e.g., H4 timeframe is bullish).
HTF POI Interaction: Price approaches or mitigates a significant HTF POI (e.g., an H4 FVG or Order Block in a discount zone of the bullish leg).
M1 Liquidity Sweep: On the M1 chart, price sweeps liquidity below a recent M1 swing low, often moving into the HTF POI.
M1 Change of Character (CHoCH): Price then impulsively breaks above the last M1 swing high, confirming the M1 CHoCH.
M1 FVG Formation: The impulsive move causing the M1 CHoCH creates a clear M1 FVG.
Entry: Enter a long position when price retraces back into this M1 FVG.
6. Stop-Loss (SL) Placement
Structural Placement: Base SL on the M1 structure that validated the entry.
Bullish Entry: Place the SL a few pips below the M1 swing low that initiated the impulsive move causing the M1 CHoCH/BoS and forming the FVG.
Bearish Entry: Place the SL a few pips above the M1 swing high that initiated the impulsive move causing the M1 CHoCH/BoS and forming the FVG.
Rationale: If this M1 swing point is breached, the immediate M1 market structure that justified the trade entry is considered invalidated.
Volatility Consideration for Gold: Given gold's volatility, allow a small buffer beyond the structural swing point. Avoid placing the SL too tightly within the M1 FVG itself, as it can be prematurely triggered by wicks or spread.
7. Profit Target (TP) Setting
Initial TP (Scalping / Short-Term Management):
Target the next opposing M1 or M5 liquidity pool. For a buy entry, this would be the nearest recent M1 or M5 swing high.
Secondary TP (Intraday Objective):
Target a more significant LTF structural point or an unmitigated FVG on a slightly higher timeframe like M15 or H1.
Ultimate TP (Aligned with HTF Bias):
If the M1 entry is strongly aligned with the established HTF directional bias and originated from a significant HTF POI, the ultimate target can be the original HTF objective (e.g., a distant H4 swing high/low or another major HTF POI).
Risk-to-Reward (R:R) Ratio: Always aim for a favorable R:R ratio, ideally 1:2 or higher, depending on the setup and market conditions.
Partial Profits: Consider taking partial profits at closer, more probable targets to secure gains and manage risk.
8. Confluence Factors (Optional Enhancements for Higher Probability)
Fibonacci Retracement:
Draw the Fibonacci tool on the M1 impulse leg that created both the M1 FVG and the M1 CHoCH/BoS.
Confluence is added if the M1 FVG aligns with key Fibonacci retracement levels (e.g., 61.8%, or the Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) zone, typically between 70.5% and 79%).
Volume Analysis:
Look for significantly higher volume accompanying the M1 impulse leg that creates the FVG.
Observe lower, diminishing volume during the retracement of price back towards the M1 FVG.
Session Dynamics:
Favor setups that occur during high-volatility trading sessions (e.g., London, New York).
Be aware of common session-based patterns, such as London Open sweeps of Asian session highs/lows that drive price into an HTF POI, potentially setting up an M1 FVG entry.
9. Important Considerations
FVGs are Probabilistic, Not Guaranteed: Understand that not all FVGs will be filled or act as perfect support/resistance. Market dynamics can change.
M1 Timeframe Noise: The M1 chart is prone to "noise" (random, insignificant price movements). Strict adherence to HTF context, multi-timeframe confirmation, and clear M1 structural signals is crucial to filter out unreliable setups.
Disciplined Risk Management: Always predefine your risk per trade (e.g., a small percentage of trading capital) and use appropriate position sizing based on your stop-loss distance.
